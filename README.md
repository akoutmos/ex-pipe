# ex-pipe

## Introduction
This is a very tiny library to help make composing functions a lot easier.
Inspiration for this library was taken from the Elixir programming language.
Specifically the pipe operator or |>. The library takes an initial value, and
an arbitrary number of pipe stages and passes the output of the previous pipe stage
as input for the next pipe stage. See usage section for examples or the Elixir School
